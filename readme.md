import the data provided, see books.sql
Add a form to add books: title, author, year, genre, description
List the books in tabular format
Edit and Delete specific books
Make sure above operations (creating, reading, updating, and deleting) works well with database table “books”
Requirements/Specs

Feel free to use any CSS styling, HTML syntax
Keep it simple
Submission

You may use images or picture of books (hint: you need to update your table to include one extra column which takes URL of picture of books)
You may host this dynamic site separately using infinityfree.com or freehostia.com or u16p.com or any other php/mysql free hosting platforms
